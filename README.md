# Isothermal heat release of cement
For an ordinary portland cement with the radius of cement as 9 micron and curing temperature of 300 K, isothermal heat release is predicted based on "shrinking-core" based kinetic model.
This model takes all the kinetics into account and uses kinetic constants corresponding to different phases of the cement hydration.
